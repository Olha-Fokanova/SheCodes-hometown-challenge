                <p>
                    The main central and historical square of Poltava has got a round
                    square. An unusual architectural ensemble was designed in the early
                    19th century. In the 1840s, the square was turned into a park with
                    radial alleys, and a ring road was built around it. Eight streets
                    diverge from the ring, and the top layout resembles the sun. The Round
                    Square complex is now a monument of classicism. In the middle of the
                    circle, there is a monument of Glory, which symbolizes the victory in
                    the Battle of Poltava. Its construction began in 1805. Alleys are
                    densely planted with dozens of species of trees and flowers, including
                    rare ones. This whole park was called the Corpus Garden. It was
                    officially opened on the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Poltava in
                    1909. It owes its unusual name to the Poltava Cadet Corps.

                    At the place where the terrible Battle of Poltava once took place, there is now a historical and
                    cultural reserve with a
                    huge scientific center. It is dedicated not only to Ukrainian history but also to all countries that
                    took part in the
                    Great Northern War.
                    There are monuments and graves of Swedes, a mass grave of the Russian army, memorial obelisks. It
                    was
                    possible to
                    preserve the ancient mounds that remained from the old settlements. The museum has as many as nine
                    themed halls where
                    you can find everything from books and paintings to weapons and medals.

                <p>
                    The Exaltation of the Cross Monastery is a nunnery built entirely in the Ukrainian Baroque style. In
                    fact, we do not
                    have a lot of such architectural monuments. There is the St. Michael’s Golden-Domed Monastery in
                    Kyiv,
                    but others can be
                    just counted on the fingers of one hand.
                    Interestingly, at first, the monastery was male. In Soviet times, it was closed and robbed, and
                    later a
                    juvenile colony
                    was set up on the territory. Then there was a boarding school in the building, and only in 1991, the
                    monastery was
                    returned to the status of a religious object.

                <p>
                    Poltava was famous for its theatrical traditions since early times. The first mentioning of local
                    stationary theater
                    dates back in 1810. And first professional theater was opened in 1818; its first director was
                    founder of
                    the modern
                    Ukrainian literature Ivan Kotlyarevsky.
                    The theater was always filled with creative, original personalities, who respected age-old
                    traditions of
                    the region.
                    And, therefore, when choosing the material for performances, the preference was mostly given to the
                    works by well-known
                    compatriot of the theatric team and wonderful writer Nikolai Gogol. The plays after his works "The
                    Christmas Eve", "The
                    Fair at Sorochyntsi" and "The Inspector General" are worth a lot!
